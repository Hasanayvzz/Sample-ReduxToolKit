## Introduction

This tutorial showcases the usage of Redux Toolkit in a React application for state management, including creating, updating state, handling asynchronous actions with `createAsyncThunk`, and making API requests.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Redux Setup

In this project, Redux state management is implemented using Redux Toolkit. The Redux store is configured in the `store.js` file.

```javascript
// src/store.js

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./features/counterSlice"; // Assuming your slice is named counterSlice

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
    // ...other reducers
  },
});

export default store;
```
